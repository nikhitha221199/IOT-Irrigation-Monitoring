Developed an IOT application for continuous agriculture field monitoring, where farmers can check humidity, temperature, and irrigation system. 
It also has a PI camera, to capture photos and videos of the field, using which the system generates alerts to farmers in case of any calamities in the field.
Built this application using Raspberry Pi 4B, PI Camera, Soil Moisture Sensor,DHT11- Temparature and Humidity sensor.
